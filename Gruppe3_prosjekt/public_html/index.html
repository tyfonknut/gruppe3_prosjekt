                    Let's break that down. We use float:left to get the nearby text to wrap around it. 
                    We set width:200px so that both the image and the caption are contained in the same box - 
                    otherwise the caption text would jut way out to the right. We set margin-right to provide a 
                    gap between the edge of the box and the text, for breathing room (note we do NOT want that margin
                    all the way around the image - just to the right, since it's floated left.) 
                    The 5px of padding provides a gap so that our border doesn't slam up against the side of the image. 
                    Finally, we apply some margin-top to match the top margin on paragraph text in our design - 
                    otherwise the top of the image would not align with the top of the nearby text. Here's what we've got so far
