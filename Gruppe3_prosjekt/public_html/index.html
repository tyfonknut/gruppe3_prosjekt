                    Lemon OS is a new innovative operating system. It is made on
                    the principles of a Lemon. Wrapped around the OS is a secure Lemon
                    peel of firewalls and backdoors for NSA to securely view the content
                    on the PC and to ensure the activity is legal and virus free.
                    Inside we have integrated Internet Explorer as the only web
                    browser to make the choice simple. With IE as the only browser you
                    can enjoy all the benefits of a fully optimized browser for your OS.<br><br>
                    Lemon OS is equipped with the brightest collection of 32 colors
                    for the 32bit version, and 64 colors for the 64bit version. The OS has
                    an integrated function called SmartColor, which is made to adapt all
                    web content to your color chart.<br><br> Lemon OS will use your webcam to take pictures at set hours
                    which will be uploaded to your SkySave and also send to NSA in case
                    of computer theft.
